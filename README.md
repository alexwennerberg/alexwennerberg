# Hello World

**Most of my active projects are on 
https://git.alexwennerberg.com and/or https://git.sr.ht/~aw**

Patches or a git-request-pull message can be sent to:
https://lists.sr.ht/~aw/patches

or my email (found on git commits)

I mirror things here sparsely. I would prefer not to.

I'm pretty active on my personal website, which I host on a
Gemini/HTTP site builder I made, [flounder](https://git.alexwennerberg.com/flounder/):
