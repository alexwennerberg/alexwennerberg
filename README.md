# Hello World

All my active projects are on 
https://git.alexwennerberg.com

Patches can be sent to:
https://lists.flounder.online/patches/

I mirror things here sparsely. I would prefer not to.

I'm pretty active on my personal website, which I host on a
Gemini/HTTP site builder I made, [flounder](https://git.alexwennerberg.com/flounder/):
