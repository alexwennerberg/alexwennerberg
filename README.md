### Hello World

* I'm pretty active on my personal website, which I host on a Gemini/HTTP site builder I made, [flounder](https://github.com/alexwennerberg/flounder): https://alexwennerberg.com/

If you don't have a GitHub account and still want to contribute to my projects, you can send use these mailing lists:

* [Patches](https://lists.sr.ht/~aw/patches)
* [Discussion](https://lists.sr.ht/~aw/hi)

I'm in the process of migrating my projects to https://git.alexwennerberg.com, which runs [mygit](https://github.com/alexwennerberg/mygit), a git server I designed.
